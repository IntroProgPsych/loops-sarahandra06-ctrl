# Write a program that first asks the user how many numbers they will enter.
# Then, using a for loop, read that many integers from the user,
# and at the end print out the LARGEST number entered.
#
# Sample interaction:
# How many numbers? 4
# Number 1: 10
# Number 2: 5
# Number 3: 27
# Number 4: 12
# The largest number was: 27
#
# Hints:
#   - Ask for the count first (how many numbers).
#   - Use a for loop that runs exactly that many times, you can use range(count) for this.
#   - Keep track of the current maximum in a variable.
#   - Update the maximum whenever you read a number that is larger.
